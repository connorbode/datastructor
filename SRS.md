### 1.1 Purpose

This project will serve as a teaching tool for data structures and algorithms.  It will allow instructors to create instances of data structures, populate those data structures with data, perform operations on those data structures, and record the sequence of manipulations to those data structures for future modification and playback.

### 1.2 Project Scope

The project will consist of the following: a server application which will provide the core functionality, accessible through a programmable interface; a suite of end-to-end tests for the server; and a web client providing a UI.
